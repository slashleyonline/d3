# D3: Sleep Clicker(Working Title)

# Game Design Vision

Based on the real-life activity of geocaching, Sleep Clicker involves sleep-deprived CS students wandering the
campus in existential crisis collecting CryptoCrap™ coins. The game's world has a random set of cells that either
contain or do not contain tokens. Players collect and combine tokens until the token reaches the value of 256.
